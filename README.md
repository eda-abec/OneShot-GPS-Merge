# OneShot report with Coordinates Merger

**os_gps_merge.py** is a Python script to match WiFi networks from reports of [OneShot](https://github.com/drygdryg/OneShot) (`stored.csv`) to their real-life coordinates.
For this, a wardriving DB is needed. Currently, a .csv file exported from [WiGLE app](https://wigle.net/tools) is supported.
Those two files are compared and their conjunction (based on MAC addresses) is then written to output file.

Matched coordinates are those with highest signal for given MAC.

You can then feed the result in CSV to [OneShot-GPS-Visualizer](https://github.com/eda-abec/OneShot-GPS-Visualizer), which displays it on map, or use arbitrary service to display KML.

This project is still in development, any suggestions and pull requests are welcome :)

### Requirements
- Python3 (Python2 is not supported!)
- libraries:
   - argparse
   - csv
   - simplekml
- the input files :)

## Usage

Makefile is included, default target runs the script.\
Make expects specific filenames.

```
make

# same as
python3 os_gps_merge.py stored.csv wigle/WigleWifi_*.csv stored_gps.csv -p pins/

# prints running time of the script
make benchmark

# delete the results file and run again
make force


#### manual running

# also export to KML, use different file for networks with only PIN available
python3 os_gps_merge.py stored.csv wigle/WigleWifi_*.csv stored_gps.csv -k stored_gps.kml --kml-pins stored_pins_gps.kml

```

From help:
```
usage: os_gps_merge.py [-h] [-d DELIMITER] [-p PINS_FOLDER] [-k KML_OUTPUT]
                       [--kml-pins KML_PINS] [--pins-output PINS_OUTPUT]

OneShot GPS Merger (c) 2020 eda-abec
based on OneShotPin 0.0.2 (c) 2017 rofl0r, modded by drygdryg

positional arguments:
  OneShot_report        Input file generated by OneShot, usually named stored.csv
  WiGLE_file            Input file(s) with APs and their GPS coordinates, generated by Wigle,
                        usually named WigleWifi_{date}.csv. Note: must be latin-1 encoded,
                        which is default
  output                Output CSV file with merged APs and GPS coordinates

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DELIMITER, --delimiter DELIMITER
                        Delimiter for output file, like semicolon (default), comma, or anything else
  -p PINS_FOLDER, --pins_folder PINS_FOLDER
                        A folder with saved PINs from Pixiewps
  -k KML_OUTPUT, --kml-output KML_OUTPUT
                        Specifies filename for KML output
  --kml-pins KML_PINS   Save PIN-only networks to separate KML file. If not specified,
                        written to default KML file
  -u UNMATCHED, --unmatched UNMATCHED
                        Output CSV file with OneShot entries not found in WiGLE
  --pins-output PINS_OUTPUT
                        Output CSV file with for PIN-only networks. If not specified,
                        written to default output file

Example: os_gps_merge.py stored.csv Wigle.csv stored_gps.csv
```

## File Formats

### CSV
#### OneShot
A standard, as-is from OneShot
```
encoding="utf-8"
delimiter=';'
```

#### WiGLE
[specification](https://api.wigle.net/csvFormat.html)

Does not have UTF-8 encoding.
```
encoding="latin-1"
delimiter=','
```

#### Output
Columns are same as in OneShot report, with `CurrentLatitude`, `CurrentLongitude` and `RSSI` added to end.
```
encoding="utf-8"
delimiter= default is ';', could be changed by -d
```

### KML
Use the `-k` option to save output to KML file. Uses standard settings:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<kml xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2" xmlns:gx="http://www.google.com/kml/ext/2.2">
...
```

## TODOs

- better name
- integrate DB from https://github.com/drygdryg/wigle_companion
- choose columns and their order in output .csv
- matching by time (not a priority, probbably will not be implemented)
- fuzzy checking (alert about unmatched network within -+hour from matched network)
- small TODOs
    - parameters
    - add switch for WiGLE encoding
    - quiet mode
    - output to stdout?
    - handle missing/incorrect input files
